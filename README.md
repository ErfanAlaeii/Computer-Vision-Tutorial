# YOLOv8 Object Detection

![YOLOv8 Logo](https://link.to.your/image.png)

This repository contains the implementation of YOLOv8 for object detection tasks. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for real-time object detection developed by the AI community.

## Installation

To use this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Download Pre-trained Weights

Before using YOLOv8 for object detection, you need to download the pre-trained weights. You can do this by running the following script:

```bash
python download_weights.py
```

This script will download the pre-trained weights and save them in the `weights` directory.

### 2. Run Object Detection

Once you have downloaded the pre-trained weights, you can run object detection on images or videos using the following command:

```bash
python detect.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

Replace `path/to/image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to perform object detection on. You can also specify a video file instead of an image.

### 3. Customize Configuration

If you want to customize the configuration of the YOLOv8 model, you can do so by editing the `config.yaml` file. This file contains various parameters such as model architecture, input size, confidence threshold, etc.
