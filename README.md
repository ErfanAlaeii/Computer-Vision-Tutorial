## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Computer-Vision-Tutorial.git
cd Computer-Vision-Tutorial
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed. You can create a virtual environment to manage dependencies more effectively.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Usage

Navigate to the tutorial you are interested in and run the respective Python scripts. Each tutorial comes with detailed explanations and code comments to guide you through the process.

```bash
cd tutorials/image_manipulation

# YOLOv8 Object Detection

![YOLOv8 Logo](https://link.to.your/image.png)

This repository contains the implementation of YOLOv8 for object detection tasks. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for real-time object detection developed by the AI community.

## Installation

To use this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Download Pre-trained Weights

Before using YOLOv8 for object detection, you need to download the pre-trained weights. You can do this by running the following script:

```bash
python download_weights.py
```

This script will download the pre-trained weights and save them in the `weights` directory.

### 2. Run Object Detection

Once you have downloaded the pre-trained weights, you can run object detection on images or videos using the following command:

```bash
python detect.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

Replace `path/to/image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to perform object detection on. You can also specify a video file instead of an image.

### 3. Customize Configuration

If you want to customize the configuration of the YOLOv8 model, you can do so by editing the `config.yaml` file. This file contains various parameters such as model architecture, input size, confidence threshold, etc.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests, please open an issue or submit a pull request.


The input format for detecting objects should be as follows:
