- **Image Manipulation**: Tutorials on image transformations, filtering, and enhancements.
- **Object Detection**: Examples of object detection using various algorithms and frameworks.
- **Face Recognition**: Implementations of face detection and recognition.
- **Deep Learning**: Tutorials on using deep learning models for computer vision tasks.
- **Project-Based Learning**: Real-world projects to apply your knowledge.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Computer-Vision-Tutorial.git
cd Computer-Vision-Tutorial
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed. You can create a virtual environment to manage dependencies more effectively.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Usage

Navigate to the tutorial you are interested in and run the respective Python scripts. Each tutorial comes with detailed explanations and code comments to guide you through the process.

```bash
cd tutorials/image_manipulation
python example_image_transform.py
```

Feel free to modify the scripts to experiment with different parameters and understand how changes affect the output.
